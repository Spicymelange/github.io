      <h2>Let's face it, you're already similar to the Honey Badger.  You just have to take it all the way</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You don't like cleaning</strong> <p>Let's be honest, you've got better things to do</p></li>
        <li><strong>You aspire to be a tough S.O.B.</strong> <p>If you're not thick-skinned, you look at people who don't let anything get them down and think "Yeah, I could do with a glow-up like that"</p></li>
        <li><strong>You'll eat anything</strong> <p>And not in the omnivore sense.  You'll eat whatever you damn well please and then swagger away from the dinner table.  Just like a Honey Badger...</p></li>
